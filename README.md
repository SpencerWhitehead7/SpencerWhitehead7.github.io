# Portfolio

A real simple HTML site that collects all my programming work/projects and bio in one place so it's easy to look at/explore. A lot of them are from before I started working professionally and I don't necessarily 100% stand behind all of them. The site is also very, very out of date.

## Future Plans

I'd like to look into using native html modules for all the duplicated html components, and the actual content of the site (skills, projects) is long past due for an update.
