# Portfolio

A real simple HTML site that collects all my programming work/projects in one place so it's easy to look at/explore. A lot of them are from before I started working professionally and I don't necessarily 100% stand behind all of them. I'm currently a software engineer at ClassPass, but please feel free to send me a message at SpencerWhitehead7 (at) gmail (dot) com

## Future Plans

I might refactor the banner animation to use request animation frame instead of setTimeout, and I'd like to look into using native html modules for all the duplicated components where the only thing that differs is text. I may also do progressive loading for the individual button images (or just compess them like crazy). The actual content of the site (skills, projects) is due for an update at some point as well. I'll also add any new side projects.
