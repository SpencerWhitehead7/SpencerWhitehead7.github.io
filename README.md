# Portfolio

A real simple HTML site that collects all my programming work/projects in one place so it's easy to look at/explore.

I'm currently looking for work as a full time, full stack web developer, so if you like what you see, please feel free to send me a message at SpencerWhitehead7 (at) gmail (dot) com

## Future Plans

I plan to keep it updated with my new work, but that's about it.
