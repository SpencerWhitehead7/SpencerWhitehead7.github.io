# Portfolio

A real simple HTML site that collects all my programming work/projects in one place so it's easy to look at/explore. A lot of them are from before I started working professionally and I don't necessarily 100% stand behind all of them. I'm currently a software engineer at ClassPass, but please feel free to send me a message at SpencerWhitehead7 (at) gmail (dot) com

## Future Plans

I might refactor the banner animation to use request animation frame instead of setTimeout, I'd like to implement the medium style background image loading effect and look into native html modules for all the duplicated components where the only thing that differs is text. I'll also add any new side projects.
