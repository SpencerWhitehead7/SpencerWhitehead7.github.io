# Portfolio

A real simple HTML site that collects all my programming work/projects in one place so it's easy to look at/explore. A lot of them are from before I started working professionally and I don't necessarily 100% stand behind all of them. I'm currently looking for work, so please feel free to send me a message at SpencerWhitehead7 (at) gmail (dot) com

## Future Plans

I'd like to look into using native html modules for all the duplicated components where the only thing that differs is text, and make to clean up the `requestAnimationFrame` implementation. The actual content of the site (skills, projects) is due for an update at some point as well. I'll also add any new side projects.
