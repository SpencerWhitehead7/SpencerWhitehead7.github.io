          <b>Description:</b> This was my group's final project at Fullstack Academy. After months of working primarily
          on websites and webapps, we decided to go way out of our comfort zones by making a security oriented app on a
          different platform with a totally new tech stack. The amount of new technical material, tight deadline, and
          unfamiliar development tools made the project extremely challenging, but I'm very proud of the final project,
          our team's work, and the amount we learned.

          <b>Description:</b> This was a solo web-scraping project I began early in 2018 and finished at Fullstack
          Academy. I actually started it before Fullstack began, but even though I managed scrape and parse sites with a
          node.js script, I had no idea how to integrate that with the website's frontend. I finished the project during
          Fullstack once I had learned more, and adapted it into a Chrome extension for a class project. It was my very
          first original project idea, so this site will always be my child.

    <h1 class="center-text">Bio</h1>

    <div class="project">
      <p>
        I graduated from University of Chicago with a Political Science degree, and spent a couple years exploring and
        working in different roles. I discovered that I loved jobs where I could learn, grow, and develop my skills,
        which led me to programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had no traditional computer science background, but I taught myself Javascript and rapidly fell in love with
        coding. I loved the creativity of breaking down complex technical problems and solving them piece by piece, and
        I loved the way every project and algorithm taught me something new. Much as I learned on my own, I wanted to
        explore programming with classmates and a curriculum, so I applied to <a
          href="https://www.fullstackacademy.com/">Fullstack Academy of Code</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fullstack is a 17 week intensive full stack (obviously?) web development bootcamp, focusing on JavaScript,
        Express, Sequelize, React, and Redux. I got a lot out of the technical parts of the program, and learned even
        more from working with my classmates and doing group projects. As a professional engineer, I've worked as TA at
        a different bootcamp, as well as at ClassPass, a small fitness startup, Northwestern Mutual, a gigantic 160 year
        old insurance company, and currently at Compass, a medium size real estate tech company. The first two roles
        were primarily frontend with React and Redux and some backend in Python and Kotlin, and Compass is a fullstack
        role with React and Go.
