After months of working primarily on websites and webapps, we decided to go way out of our comfort zones by making a security oriented app on a different platform with a totally new tech stack. The amount of new technical material, tight deadline, and unfamiliar development tools made the project extremely challenging, but I'm very proud of the final project, our team's work, and the amount we learned.

            <b>Description:</b> This was a solo web-scraping project I began early in 2018 and finished at Fullstack Academy. I actually started it before Fullstack began, but even though I managed scrape and parse sites with a node.js script, I had no idea how to integrate that with the website's frontend. I finished the project during Fullstack once I had learned more, and adapted it into a Chrome extension for a class project. It was my very first original project idea, so this site will always be my child.

The Markov chain script is generalizable and could be used to generate chains and quotes from any input text. The website uses a precomputed Markov chain derived from Danaher's posts to generate the quotes. This project was especially exciting because it was inspired by <a href="http://thomasfriedmanopedgenerator.com/about.php">the Thomas Friedman op-ed generator</a>, which had seemed like an impossible mystery to me until I started programming.

      <div class="project">
        <p>
          I graduated from University of Chicago with a Political Science degree, and spent a couple years exploring and working in different roles. I discovered that I loved jobs where I could learn, grow, and develop my skills, which eventually led me to coding.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          I had no traditional computer science background, but I taught myself Javascript and rapidly fell in love with programming. I loved the creativity of breaking down complex technical problems and solving them piece by piece, and I loved the way every project and algorithm taught me something new. Much as I learned on my own, I wanted to explore programming with classmates and a curriculum, so I applied to <a href="https://www.fullstackacademy.com/">Fullstack Academy of Code</a>.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Fullstack is a 17 week intensive full stack (obviously?) web development bootcamp, focusing on JavaScript, Express, Sequelize, React, and Redux. I got a lot out of the technical parts of the program, but I learned even more from working with my classmates and doing group projects. Since the end of the program, I've been working on my own projects, learning more basic CS, and looking for full time software engineering positions.
