        The iPhone store made deployment impractical, unfortunately

        This was my group's final project at Fullstack Academy. We created an end-to-end encrypted IOS app using React-Native and Firebase. After months of working primarily on websites and webapps, we decided to go way out of our comfort zones by making a security oriented app on a different platform with a totally new tech stack. The amount of new technical material, tight deadline, and unfamiliar development tools made the project extremely challenging, but I'm very proud of the final project, our team's work, and the amount we learned.

        Why, it's the very site you're on now! This site is noteworthy solely for the fact that it's the first site I've ever made with just HTML and CSS. It's included in the projects section because I'm  a completionist.
