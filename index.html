                  This was my group's final project at Fullstack Academy. After months of working primarily on websites and webapps, we decided to go way out of our comfort zones by making a security oriented app on a different platform with a totally new tech stack. The amount of new technical material, tight deadline, and unfamiliar development tools made the project extremely challenging, but I'm very proud of the final project, our team's work, and the amount we learned.

        Why, it's the very site you're on now! This site is noteworthy solely for the fact that it's the first site I've ever made with just HTML and CSS. It's included in the projects section because I'm  a completionist.

    <h2>Bio, or, why are you a programmer?</h2>

    <p>
      In 2015, I graduated from University of Chicago with a degree in Political Science, then promptly spent two years not using it. I did do a pretty wide range of other things, including but not limited to interning at The Innocence Project, being a TA at a Stanford academic summer program, and working as a ski instructor. I learned a lot from these jobs, including that I really loved the jobs where I could learn and grow and always be developing my skills. In the beginning of 2018, I started looking for a long term career with those kinds of opportunities, and several of my friends suggested programming.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I had no technical or computer science background, but I started teaching myself Javascript and rapidly fell in love with it. I loved the creativity of breaking down complex technical problems and solving them piece by piece, and I loved the way every project or algorithm I tried taught me something new or gave me a new way to look at old problems. However, I knew I'd learn more, faster, in a group environment with classmates and a curriculum, so I applied to a bootcamp called <a href="https://www.fullstackacademy.com/">Fullstack Academy of Code</a>.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Fullstack was a 17 week intensive program that taught full stack (obviously?) Javascript web development, focusing on Express, Sequelize, React, and Redux. Much as I learned from the technical parts of the program, the opportunities to do group projects and help or be helped by my classmates were amazing as well. I got a ton out of the program, and since it ended, I've been looking for full time work as a software engineer.
