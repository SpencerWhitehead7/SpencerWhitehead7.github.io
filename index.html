          different platform with a totally new tech stack. The amount of new technical material, tight deadline, and
          unfamiliar development tools made the project extremely challenging, but I'm very proud of the final project,
          our team's work, and the amount we learned.

          Fullstack once I had learned more, and adapted it into a Chrome extension for a class project. It was my very
          first original project idea, so this site will always be my child.

    <h1 class="center-text">Bio</h1>

    <div class="project">
      <p>
        I graduated from University of Chicago with a Political Science degree, and spent a couple years exploring and
        working in different roles. I discovered that I loved jobs where I could learn, grow, and develop my skills,
        which led me to programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had no traditional computer science background, but I taught myself Javascript and rapidly fell in love with
        coding. I loved the creativity of breaking down complex technical problems and solving them piece by piece, and
        I loved the way every project and algorithm taught me something new. Much as I learned on my own, I wanted to
        explore programming with classmates and a curriculum, so I applied to <a
          href="https://www.fullstackacademy.com/">Fullstack Academy of Code</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fullstack is a 17 week intensive full stack (obviously?) web development bootcamp, focusing on JavaScript,
        Express, Sequelize, React, and Redux. I got a lot out of the technical parts of the program, but learned even
        more from working with my classmates and doing group projects. After the program, I worked as a TA at a
        different bootcamp, and as a software engineer at Classpass, primarily doing frontend work with React/Redux and
        a little bit of server programming in Python and Kotlin. I am once again looking for work, so please feel free
        to...
